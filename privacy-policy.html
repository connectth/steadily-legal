  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 24, 2026</p>

  <p>Steadily ("we", "our", or "us") is operated by Twinhearth Studio. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use the Steadily app.</p>

  <p>We take your privacy seriously — especially given the sensitive nature of co-parenting communication. We collect only what we need, and we never sell your data.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We collect the following information when you use Steadily:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account information:</strong> your name and email address when you register</li>
    <li><strong>Family data:</strong> parenting schedule information, custody calendar entries, and schedule change requests that you and your co-parent create together</li>
    <li><strong>Messages:</strong> in-app messages sent between co-parents within the app</li>
    <li><strong>Child information:</strong> children's names, dates of birth, and any medical or emergency contact information you choose to store</li>
    <li><strong>Mood check-ins:</strong> mood data logged for children by parents</li>
    <li><strong>Handover details:</strong> handover locations, times, and notes you enter</li>
    <li><strong>Device information:</strong> device token for push notifications (via Firebase Cloud Messaging)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use your information solely to provide the Steadily service:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To enable co-parenting coordination between two parents in a shared family account</li>
    <li>To send push notifications about schedule changes, messages, and app activity</li>
    <li>To display shared calendar, messaging, and child information to both parents in your family</li>
    <li>To maintain a secure, timestamped record of communications and schedule changes</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not use your data for advertising, profiling, or any purpose beyond operating the app.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>Your data is stored securely using Google Firebase (Firestore), hosted in the European Union (Frankfurt, Germany — europe-west3 region). Firebase is compliant with GDPR and industry security standards.</p>
  <p>We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your personal data against unauthorised access, loss, or disclosure.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties, except:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Your co-parent:</strong> data you enter in the shared family account is visible to both parents in that family, as intended by the app's design</li>
    <li><strong>Google Firebase:</strong> our backend infrastructure provider (data processor under GDPR)</li>
    <li><strong>Google Firebase Cloud Messaging:</strong> used to deliver push notifications to your device</li>
    <li><strong>Legal requirements:</strong> if required by law or to protect our legal rights</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>Steadily is designed for use by adults (parents and guardians). We do not knowingly collect personal information directly from children. Information about children (such as names, dates of birth, and medical notes) is entered by parents and is protected under this policy.</p>
  <p>If you believe a child has provided us with personal information directly, please contact us and we will delete it promptly.</p>

  <h2>6. Your Rights (GDPR)</h2>
  <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area, you have the following rights regarding your personal data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access:</strong> you can request a copy of the data we hold about you</li>
    <li><strong>Correction:</strong> you can ask us to correct inaccurate data</li>
    <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> you can request that we delete your account and all associated data</li>
    <li><strong>Portability:</strong> you can request your data in a portable format</li>
    <li><strong>Objection:</strong> you can object to how we process your data</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at <a href="mailto:twinhearthstudio@gmail.com">twinhearthstudio@gmail.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain your data for as long as your account is active. If you delete your account, we will delete your personal data within 30 days, except where we are required to retain it by law.</p>

  <h2>8. Push Notifications</h2>
  <p>We use Firebase Cloud Messaging to send push notifications. You can disable push notifications at any time through your device settings. Disabling notifications does not affect your ability to use the app.</p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of significant changes via the app or by email. The date at the top of this page shows when the policy was last updated.</p>
